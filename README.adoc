Explore how to create a GraphQL service using Microprofile GraphQL on Open Liberty

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple GraphQL service with Microprofile GraphQL. 
The service will respond to `POST` requests made to the `http://localhost:9080/graphql` URL. 
The `POST` requests will contain a query with a requested resource and a list of properties within that resource.
GraphQL will respond with the desired resource and only the properties listed. 

This is beneficial when dealing with large resources or ones which contain properties that are expensive to calculate. 
By returning only the requested properties, GraphQL reduces the size of the responses. 
For resources that contain properties that are expensive to calculate such as other nested resources, GraphQL reduces processing time by only calculating them if requested. 

Unlike REST services, all GraphQL requests go to the same endpoint. 
Requests are differentiated by the contents of the request rather than the endpoint, which can simplify your application. 

You can learn more about GraphQL by visiting https://graphql.org/[their webpage^].

Included with the application is a service called GraphiQL. 
GraphiQL is a webpage served by the Open Liberty server and can be used to assist in development and testing of the service.
GraphiQL allows you to easily make `POST` requests to the GraphQL service and see the responses.

Once the server is running, access the schema at the http://localhost:9080/graphql/schema.graphql[^] URL. 
The schema informs you of the queries available in the service as well as the possible resources that can be retrieved. 
Open GraphiQL at the http://localhost:9080/graphiql.html[^] URL. 
Run the following query command in GraphiQL to get every property available. 

[role='command']
----
query {
  system {
    java {
      vendor
      version
    }
    operatingSystem {
      arch
      version
      name
    }
    username
    timezone
  }
}
----

The output will be similar to the following:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "java": {
        "vendor": "Oracle Corporation",
        "version": "13.0.2"
      },
      "operatingSystem": {
        "arch": "x86_64",
        "version": "10.15.6",
        "name": "Mac OS X"
      },
      "username": "admin",
      "timezone": "America/Toronto"
    }
  }
}
----

Run the following mutation command to add a note to the system.

[role='command']
----
mutation {
  editNote(note:"I am trying out GraphQL on OpenLiberty!")
}
----

You will receive a response containing the boolean `true` to notify you that the request was processed.
You can see the note you added by running the following query.

[role='command']
----
query {
  system {
    note
  }
}
----

The response will be similar to the following:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "system": {
      "note": "I am trying out GraphQL on OpenLiberty!"
    }
  }
}
----

Notice that this time, only the `note` property is returned, as it was the only property in the query request.

Adding the [hotspot=graphql file=0]`mpGraphQL` feature to the [hotspot file=0]`server.xml` 
and the [hotspot=graphQLDependency file=1]`microprofile-graphql-api` dependency to the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` 
enables the GraphQL runtime and use of the GraphQL API for your application.

== Implementing GraphQL

In GraphQL the available functions of the application are described by a schema. 
When the application is running, the schema can be viewed at the `http://localhost:9080/graphql/schema.graphql` URL. 
The schema will describe available object types and resolvers.

Object types define the structure of the data that can be returned by GraphQL.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `JavaInfo.java` file.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/JavaInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot file=0]`JavaInfo.java` file will configure the `Java` object in GraphQL.
This object will describe information about the system's Java installation. 
The [hotspot=type file=0]`@Type` annotation maps the [hotspot file=0]`JavaInfo.java` file to defining the `Java` object in GraphQL. 

The [hotspot=description file=0]`@Description` annotation gives a description to the `Java` object in GraphQL. 

The [hotspot=name1 hotspot=name2 file=0]`@Name` annotations map their respective properties to properties of the `Java` object in GraphQL. 
Any of these properties can also be marked with the [hotspot=nonnull file=0]`@NonNull` annotation.
This makes it so that when they're requested by GraphQL, they're guaranteed to not be `null`.
The [hotspot=getVendor file=0]`getVendor()` and [hotspot=getVersion file=0]`getVersion()` getter functions will automatically be mapped to retrieve their respective properties in GraphQL. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `OperatingSystem.java` file.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/OperatingSystem.java`
----
[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemInfo.java` file.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemInfo.java`
----

The [hotspot file=1]`OperatingSystem.java` and [hotspot file=2]`SystemInfo.java` files will be very similar to the [hotspot file=0]`JavaInfo.java` file.
[hotspot file=1]`OperatingSystem.java` will configure the `OperatingSystem` object in GraphQL to describe information about the operating system the application is running on. 
[hotspot file=2]`SystemInfo.java` will configure the `System` object in GraphQL to describe information about the operating system the application is running on. 

// file 0
JavaInfo.java
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/JavaInfo.java[]
----

// file 1
OperatingSystem.java
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/OperatingSystem.java[]
----

// file 2
SystemInfo.java
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/models/SystemInfo.java[]
----

Resolvers are functions that will define what operations can be performed to retrieve or modify data. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=3" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemResource.java` file.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/SystemResource.java`
----

The resolvers are defined in the [hotspot file=3]`SystemResource.java` file.
The [hotspot=graphqlapi file=3]`@GraphQLApi` annotation makes it so that GraphQL will use the methods defined in this class. 

The [hotspot=query file=3]`@Query` annotation maps the [hotspot=getSystemInfo file=3]`getSystemInfo()` function to handling `system` requests. 

The [hotspot=mutation file=3]`@Mutation` annotation maps the [hotspot=editNote file=3]`editNote()` function to handling `editNote` requests. 
The [hotspot=editNoteHeader file=3]`@Name` annotation denotes inputs for the mutation request. 
Here the input will determine a note to write into the system properties. 

Each resolver function has an [hotspot=description1 hotspot=description2 file=3]`@Description` annotation which gives it a description in the schema. 

Thhe [hotspot=operatingSystemHeader hotspot=javaHeader file=3]`@Source` annotation is used to add properties to object types. 
Here it adds [hotspot=java file=3]`JavaInfo` and [hotspot=os file=3]`OperatingSystem` objects as properties 
to the `SystemInfo` object that is returned for the `system` request defined earlier.
This annotation is used for any properties that are expensive to calculate or look up.
These properties will only be calculated or looked up if requested, saving server time and resources. 
Here is it used for the [hotspot=java file=3]`JavaInfo` and [hotspot=os file=3]`OperatingSystem` object types. 

// file 3

== Testing the application

Manual tests can be done using GraphiQL at the http://localhost:9080/graphiql.html[^] URL. 
However, automated tests are a better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug.
